## Generate SVG from PNG

Starting reading a `png` file, script compress image using `RLE` (run-length encoding) and then recreate image in a `svg` format.

## RLE encoding

`Run-length encoding (RLE)` is a form of lossless data compression in which runs of data (sequences in which the same data value occurs in many consecutive data elements) are stored as a single data value and count, rather than as the original run.
